# Contributions to ![AUX](aux_logo_4c.svg)

While AUX is available under an open source license (GPL 3, see [COPYING
file](COPYING)), [DeusO GmbH](https://deuso.de/) uses AUX commercially,
including offering the library under proprietary licenses.

This prevents us from accepting external contributions to the library,
unless the contributor agrees to either assign the copyright for their
contribution to DeusO GmbH, or grants DeusO GmbH a license allowing
DeusO GmbH to treat the contributions entirely as if DeusO GmbH held the
copyright to them. This means that your contributions also must be
unencumbered by rights of any other person or entity, meaning that for
example they may not include code from other projects even if they are
released under an Open Source license.

When submitting contributions, please kindly indicate that you agree to
these conditions, for example by stating

> I offer this contribution in accordance with the terms laid out in the
> [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) document from the AUX repository.

## Copyright/License grant

**By offering my contribution, I confirm that the contribution is free
from any third party rights, and I assign the copyright to DeusO GmbH
or, if that is not possible, grant DeusO GmbH a world-wide, exclusive,
non-revokeable license to treat my contribution entirely as if DeusO
GmbH owned the copyright to it.**
