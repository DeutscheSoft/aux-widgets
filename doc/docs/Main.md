## AUX Audio Widget Library API Documentation

This is the official documentation for the AUX audio widget library.
This documentation consists of several introductory parts, which explain how
AUX Widgets interact with the DOM and how they can be layouted.
In addition this documentation contains a complete API documentation of all
Widget classes and a series of interactive examples, which explain how widgets
can be used in practice.

which is also where we track bugs and feature requests.

AUX is developed by [DeusO GmbH](http://deuso.de) and is used in user interfaces for professional audio
equipment in broadcast, recording and production worldwide.

### Requirements

AUX should work in all browser which support ECMAScript 6.
