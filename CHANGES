* Initial options are now passed in the constructor for all widgets,
  instead of being passed to initialize() only
* Meter: title has been renamed to label
* MultiMeter: title has been renamed to label
* Graph: removed 'graphchanged' event
* Grid: removed 'gridchanged' event
* Meter: removed 'labelchanged', 'valuechanged' and 'basechanged' events

* Circular/Knob/ValueKnob: rename and remove some options - dot=>dots_default,
  label=>labels_default, marker=>markers_default, title=>label
* Select: title has been renamed to label
* Colorpicker: title has been renamed to label
* ResponseHandle has been renamed to ChartHandle
* Widget: removed the 'active' option and the corresponding 'aux-inactive' CSS
  class

  CSS classes.
  

Tests
=====

* Added a visual regression testsuite using BackstopJS
* Added static code analysis using jshint

Styles

Toolkit 1.3: Changes since Toolkit 1.2
--------------------------------------

Style Changes
=============

* Flex-Layout: The following widgets have a changed layout based on flex-box and grid:
  * Fader (new DOM element: _track as container for _handle)

Fixes
=====

* TK.element: object argument wasn't handled as attributes but as styles
  opposed to what the documentation says. This might break backward compatibility
  in some cases.
* TK.DragValue: new option `limit` to keep value to be set between `min` and `max`.
  added to `TK.Knob` and `TK.Fader` by default which disables `toolkit-warning`-class
  by default in favour of less nervous lower and upper ends in those widgets.
* Fixed rendering issues in inverted levelmeters with segments
  
Features
========

* TK.Value: New options
  * `type` sets the type attribute of the input child
  * `placeholder` sets the placeholder attribute of the input child
  * `editmode` sets whether the userset event fires on hitting enter (`onenter`) or immediately after every key press (`immediate`)
* TK.Dialog was officially added (including docs, CSS and AWML abilities)
* TK.Color: new universal conversion functions taking any kind of color parameter or model

New
===

* TK.ColorPicker and TK.ColorPickerDialog officially went into master.

Changes
=======

* TK.Pager: drop option `overlap` due to new flex layout was already missing since 1.3 but not removed.
* TK.Button: options.layout defaults to "horizontal".

Toolkit 1.2: Changes since Toolkit 1.1
--------------------------------------

New Features
============

o added DragCapture. DragCapture implements a pointer capture logic. It is now used
  in DragValue, Drag and ResponseHandler. It automatically supports multi touch.

o Iconset as font

Improvements
============

o DragValue: The 'blind_angle' option now applies to all choices of the 'direction'
  option.

o DragValue: can be reversed by setting the option "reverse" to true.

o Drag: supports CSS transformations if option "transform" is set to true.

o ResponseHandle: has real MultiTouch support. This also applies to the z_handling
  gesture, which means that any number of touch points can now drag handles in the
  EQ.

o Button/Toggle: set URL or class name for icon

o Faders got title and value ChildWidgets.

o Scale: New child elements pointer and bar to visualize values within Scale.

o Window: complete rewrite. Less DOM nodes, less complexity, using new
  toolkit APIs. Additionally layout switched from table-like div zoo to
  more slick flexbox.

o Value: new option "readonly"

o Refactorering to allow using toolkit in module context. This allows
  using it from within Angular or similar frameworks and to bundle it
  with tools such as webpack.

o ValueKnob: All children are of class ChildWidget now. This breaks the
  use of "label" option for TK.Label, had to be renamed to "title".
  
o MeterBase: Title and value label are real widgets now. Their name changed
  so they don't have an underscore any more:
  _label -> label and _title -> title

o MultiMeter: Title is a ChildWidget now. Name changed from _title to title.
  
o ValueButton: _bar, _base and marker were removed in favour of new Scale ChildWidget.
x

API Changes
===========

o The return value of event handlers is processed differently now.
  Any return value which is not undefined will interrupt the execution of
  any other handlers. fire_event will return that value.
  This change was necessary because some DOM events use values !== false for
  cancellation. It also makes more complex signalling logic possible for events.
  This is used by the new DragCapture class.
  
o Circular elements switched the option for the opening angle from "basis"
  to "angle". This is to separate the distance to drag on Knob and ValueKnob
  from the angle.
  
o Window: All sub elements are real widgets now using the new ChildWidget API.
  There's only header and footer element left, header_left, header_center, header_right,
  footer_left, footer_center and footer_right are removed.
  The options are reduced to only header and footer, too. Setting one of them
  to false removes the element from the window. It's not possible to set
  simple strings without being wrapped in an array anymore.
  
  There's a new element to be added to header or footer: "resize".
  
  The option "resizable" was dropped in favour of setting "resize"
  in "header" or "footer".

o Window: "resize" handle had to be renamed since it overwrote the resize function
  handle. New identifier for the resize handle is "size".
  
  TODO: startdrag and stopdrag events aren't fired in TK.Drag. This stops
  Window from un-maximizing and other things.
  
Style Changes
=============

* Flex-Layout: The following widgets have a changed layout based on flex-box and grid:
  * Button (_cell member was dropped, icon and label are direct flex children)
  * ButtonArray
  * ValueKnob
  * MeterBase
  * LevelMeter
  * Select
  * Pager
  * MultiMeter
  * ValueButton
  
Toolkit 1.1: Changes since Toolkit 1.0
-----------------------------------------

New Features
============

o added MultiLevelMeter widget.

o Events can now be cancelled by returning 'false' from an event handler. When
  used for native DOM events this will make the native event handler to return
  false, aswell.

o The userset() method was added to all widgets. It is used internally whenever
  an option is changed by user interaction. It fires the 'userset' event, which
  has the same API as the 'useraction' event. The 'userset' event can be
  cancelled, in which case the option will not be set. This can be used to
  prevent or restrict user interaction.

Improvements
============

o rewrote most of the rendering path of ResponseHandle. The code
  is now more concise and supports different settings more flexibly.
  For instance, the z_handle can now be positioned in all 8 positions
  for all modes

o rewrote the mouse/touch-event handling in Toggle. In particular it now
  properly handles multiple touchpoints and should work more reliable in
  edge cases.

o The mouseevents in DragValue and ResponseHandle will now compare the button
  state between different events. When the button state changes, the drag
  action will be cancelled. This works around problems where the mouseup
  event is not received.

API Changes
===========

o the add_event() method no longer accepts flags to automatically
  preventDefault or stopPropagation. These have to be called manually now.

o The 'pointerdown' and 'pointerup' synthetic events have been removed.

Toolkit 1.0.0: Changes since Toolkit 0.66
-----------------------------------------

Browser support
===============

o added many compatibility helpers to support older browsers. Most widgets
  work in IE9 and upwards. The list of supported browsers will change in future
  versions.

API Changes
===========

o Every widget must to be a descendant of an instance of TK.Root in order
  to be drawn and resized correctly. See 'docs/rendering.md' for details.

o The set() method now returns the actual value set. Note that this value can be
  different from the value passed, for example when using grid snapping.

Improvements
============

o moved all documentation to jsdoc syntax

o documented more options and methods

o added an option 'element' to allow widgets to resuse an existing
  DOM element

o added many warnings and diagnostics for incorrect options or wrong API calls

o reimplemented TK.Scale to draw better automatic scales and labels

o added the TK.Expander widget. It can be used to implement complex logic to
  interfaces more responsive. See its documentation for more information.

o added multi-touch support to TK.DragValue, which for example now allows
  dragging several faders simultaneously.

o added standard gain to decibel full scale transformations to AudioMath

Cleanup
=======

o Used explicit child selectors for most widgets. This is usually faster
  and avoid possible mismatches in containers (e.g. Pager).

o Separated the CSS definitions of all widgets into 'functional' definitions
  and those for layout/design. This simplifies creating custom stylesheets.

o Activated JavaScript strict-mode in all source files.

o Replaced all toolkit constants by strings.
  This is an incompatible change.

o Moved many 'internal' functions into real private helper methods.

o reduced the number of leaked event callbacks

o string labels are now always interpreted as text. Adding more complex labels
  is still supported by passing a DOM element or a document fragment.
  This is an incompatible change.

o Avoid using the global namespace for any variables. All toolkit classes
  and functions are now available in the 'TK' namespace. All widgets are
  still added to the global scope for compatibility. They will be removed from
  the global scope in a future version.

o Removed all non ASCII characters from the source code to avoid encoding
  errors.

o Avoid multiple inheritance where possible.

Performance improvements
========================

o LevelMeter now uses a canvas overlay. It also optimizes the rendering
  of segmented level meters.

o Added standalone version of TK.sprintf.

o Pager was reimplemented to use CSS transitions and remove hidden pages
  from the DOM.

o Implemented new tooltip widgets which does not require a relayout.

o Only redraw or resize the visible parts of the widget tree.

o Redesigned how the DOM resize event API is used. All widgets now resize
  automatically, by doing necessary measurements once after a resize event.

o Added a clean representation of a widget tree.

o Ranged: implemented faster and cleaner snap methods as asm.js modules. Note
  that the 'nosnap' option was removed.

o Moved rendering of all widgets into a redraw method. The code was also
  refactored to redraw only those parts of the DOM, which depend on options
  which have changed since the last redraw.

o Implemented all filters and other audio-related transformations as asm.js
  modules

o DOM scheduling

  DOM scheduling is a technique, which aims to reorder DOM API calls in order
  to optimize rendering performance. It is implemented using a simple priority
  based scheduler, which runs all operations in an animation callback.
  See 'docs/rendering.md' for more details.

o Used more local variables where possible to avoid unecessary lookups.

o Use CSS in favour of JavaScript
  
  Simplify rendering of widgets by removing lots of JavaScript layouting
  code replacing it with CSS. This breaks older layouts which have to be
  refactored in order to reflect the changes done to CSS.
  
o Simplify DOM of widgets by using techniques like pseudo CSS elements
  for drawing dynamic background compositions like in Fader
  
o Re-layout some widgets to have most of the layout options formerly
  flagged with "initialize" changeable on runtime
  
o Add some more layout options to some widgets like Fader

Changes before version 0.66
---------------------------

o removed mootools dependency

o added a custom sprintf implementation
