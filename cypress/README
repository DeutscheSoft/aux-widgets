# Install

`npm ci`

# First Run

`npx cypress open`

## Note: cypress application needs a constant http-server, e.g. pike -x httpserver in the aux-widgets directory.

# Cypress creates itself a dir and places screenshots in the default location for now. Cypress in this way opens the application in a browser UI.

# Testing via CMD line

## Headless

`npm run test-cmd`

## Headed

`npm run test-head`
